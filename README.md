## Overview

This reference design demonstrates a **multi-camera, multi-model AI pipeline** using the **Tria VisionAI-Kit 6490**. Built with **Python, GTK, and GStreamer**, this GUI-based application allows users to:

- 🔄 Run **up to two AI models concurrently** on separate camera inputs  
- 🎥 Stream live camera feeds with overlays from selected AI models  
- 📊 Visualize **real-time system performance and thermal metrics**  
- 🚀 Leverage Qualcomm’s **Hexagon DSP AI Engine** for efficient, low-power inference  

Currently supported ML pipelines include:
- Pose Detection  
- Depth Segmentation  
- Object Detection  
- Image Classification

With potential for more!

## 📈 System Monitoring

The design integrates two utilities for performance monitoring:
- **QProf** (Qualcomm's common Linux profiler)  
- **psutil** (a cross-platform system utility)  

### Live Metrics:
- CPU / Memory / GPU utilization  
- LPDDR5, CPU, and GPU temperature graphs  
- Track last N seconds (N=30 by default)
